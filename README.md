# Sinister Descent
*"Legends of old
Have mentions untold,
Of treasures that lay
in deep dark's embrace.*

*Those who set out,
To claim that fate whole,
Must face their own
Sinister Descent."*

## Sinister Descent is
a rogue-like game built with the Sinister Engine, an engine custom built for text-based games. The main premise of the game is to continue an endless descent deeper and deeper into the depths, going through a cycle between shop and battle. After each fight you have a chance to take a breather and power yourself up before the next encounter.

**The game alongside the engine is still in early development!**
