# Sinister Descent
*"Legends of old  
Have mentions untold,  
Of treasures that lay  
in deep dark's embrace.*

*Those who set out,  
To claim that fate whole,  
Must face their own  
Sinister Descent."*

## Sinister Descent is
a rogue-like game built with the Sinister Engine, an engine custom built for text-based games. The main premise of the game is to continue an endless descent deeper and deeper into the depths, going through a cycle between shop and battle. After each fight you have a chance to take a breather and power yourself up before the next encounter.

## Run instructions
To play Sinister Descent, you first need to make sure you have java. The minimum officially supported JRE version is 17. We cannot guarantee proper functionality for anything below that. The game is only fully supported for terminals with support for [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code). Most Linux terminals should fall into that category, as well as VSCode's in-built one. For Windows users, the CMD or Powershell terminals *DO NOT SUPPORT ANSI ESCAPE CODES.* If you are on Windows, please run the game through something like VSCode's terminal, or [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org).

To actually run the game, simply download the newest .zip in the [releases](https://github.com/Vicvip23/sinister-descent/releases) tab, unpack it, open the folder in your favorite terminal emulator, and run `java -jar sinister-descent.jar`. Enjoy!

**The game alongside the engine is still in early development!**
